# Method

##Pathways

There exist four different pathays depending if the case has been hospitalised and/or survived. The date associated with the four health seeking pathways are given in the following table: 

|                  | Onset | Hospitalisation | Death | Discharge | Report |
|------------------|-------|-----------------|-------|-----------|--------|
| $HD$             |   X   |        X        |   X   |           |    X   |
| $H\bar{D}$       |   X   |        X        |       |     X     |    X   |
| $\bar{HD}$       |   X   |                 |   X   |           |    X   |
| $\bar{H}\bar{D}$ |   X   |                 |       |           |    X   |

## Notations

For each individual $i$, we denote $y_i^k$ $(k=1, \ldots, n_{g_i})$ the observed data for that individual. 
The number of observed data $n_{g_i}$ can depend on characteristics of the individual, defined by a grouping so that individual $i$ is in group $g_i$. 

Here, we consider observed data as being epidemiologically relevant dates, which depend on the path of the individual (see table above): if the individual was hospitalised and died ($g_i=HD$) or was hospitalised and did not die ($g_i=H\bar{D}$), $n_{g_i}=4$; if the individual was not hospitalised and died ($g_i=\bar{H}D$), $n_{g_i}=3$; if the individual was not hospitalised and died ($g_i=\bar{H}\bar{D}$), $n_{g_i}=2$.

We assume that each data (here date) can have been recorded with error, or can be missing in the observations. Hence we introduce augmented data $D_i^k$ $(k=1, \ldots, n_{g_i})$, where $D_i^k$ is the true data corresponding to the observed data $y_i^k$. 

## Likelihood

### Observation level

This level describes the link between the observed and the tru data: 
$P\left(y_i^k|D_i^k\right) = h_{\theta_h}\left(D_i^k\right)$.

NOTE: discuss what $h_{\theta_h}$ should be; could include conditions such as error on onset date > error on death date

### Difference level

This level describes the difference between two observations: 
for $k\geq 2$, $P\left(D_i^k|D_i^{k-1}, g_i\right) = f_{k-1, k}^{g_i}\left(D_i^{k-1}\right)$. 

We use discretised gamma distributions for $f_{k-1, k}^{g_i}$. 

<!--In our example, we assume that the distribution of the delay between exposure and onset $f_{E, O}^{g_i}=f_{E, O}$ does not depend on the group - NOT RELEVANT FOR NOW AS NOT CONSIDERING EXPOSURE DATE -->

### Full posterior distribution

The joint posteior distribution of parameters and augmented data given observed data is:

$\begin{aligned}
P\left(\zeta, \alpha^{k, g_i}, \beta^{k, g_i}, D_i^k, E_i^k | g_i, y_i^k\right) \propto& P\left(\zeta, \alpha, \beta, D, E, g, y\right) \\
  \propto& P\left(y | D, E, \zeta, \alpha, \beta, g\right) P\left(E | \zeta, D, \alpha, \beta, g\right) P\left(D | \zeta, D, \alpha, \beta, g\right) P\left(\zeta\right) P\left(\alpha\right) P\left(\beta\right)\\
    \propto& P\left(y | D, E\right) P\left(E | \zeta\right) P\left(D | \zeta, D, \alpha, \beta, g\right)P\left(\zeta\right) P\left(\alpha\right) P\left(\beta\right)
\end{aligned}$

where $P\left(D | \zeta, D, \alpha, \beta, g\right) \propto \prod_i \prod_{k=2}^{n_{g_i}} P\left( D_i^k | D_i^{k-1}, \alpha, \beta \right)$ (assuming a uniform prior for $D_i^1$). 




## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
