## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##Pathways

There exist four different pathays depending if the case has been hospitalised and/or survived. The date associated with the four health seeking pathways are given in the following table: 

|                  | Onset | Hospitalisation | Death | Discharge | Report |
|------------------|-------|-----------------|-------|-----------|--------|
| $HD$             |   X   |        X        |   X   |           |    X   |
| $H\bar{D}$       |   X   |        X        |       |     X     |    X   |
| $\bar{HD}$       |   X   |                 |   X   |           |    X   |
| $\bar{H}\bar{D}$ |   X   |                 |       |           |    X   |
